# Recommendation

## Before printing

We provide "TestPart-Stargate-Front.stl" part to test printing 1/9 of the front stargate part.<br>
It allows you to test material or print settings before doing the big part.

We recommend you to print these parts using the color or plastic of your choice :

- TestPart-Stargate-Front.stl
- Light-chevron-0.2mm_x18.stl
- symbol-light-guide_0.2mm-x36.stl
- symbol-template1_0.2mm-x1.stl

It is better if you also have one WS2812B to test the chevron and symbol lightning.<br>
The LED shouldn't be at full power to test symbols, only 5/255 PWM is enough to see it clearly.<br>
It could be higher for chevron but your don't gain anything going beyond 160/255 except excessive power loss.<br>

If you want to use a resin printer for symbols you can, but you will likely have to paint them because resin transparency is not adequate in our experience.
