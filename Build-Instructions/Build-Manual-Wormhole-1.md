## Cut the plexiglass

You need a 2 mm sheet of plexiglass. Be carefull with compass, it could leave horrible trace.

You need to cut circle of 161.5 mm into a plexiglass sheet.
You will need to cut the lower part at the right height using a dremel or use "Plexgliass-Template-Dummy.stl" as template for laser cut.

- Ensure the plexiglass part fit into "Inner-ring-0.4mm_x1.stl". You shouldn't need to force to insert it to should fit easily. Sand a little bit if necessary. DON'T GLUE IT YET !

## Apply half-way mirror film

Remove the plastic protection on the mirror film, it could be a nightmare to find but it's there.
You cannot apply it directly to the plexiglass, it won't work it will just create something horrible full of bubble and ruin your nice work.
You can check on youtube there are several tutorial about how to apply it but basically you need:
- Cut the film, it should be 1 inch bigger on every side. Ensure you get a nice spot, sometime the film could be slighly damaged. Inspect just to be sure. 
- Apply water mixed with soap using a spray bottle over the plexiglass
- Remove the protection film from the mirror film
- Stick the mirror film over the plexiglass, use a ruler to push water bubble ouside

## Glue the plexiglass to "Inner-ring-0.4mm_x1.stl"

The ring shouldn't be assembled, you need to remove 9 allens screws behind the ring.

- Glue the plexiglass to the inner ring using canopy glue.

## Glue the filter

The filter "Wormhole-filter.stl" is just a white PLA filter to diffuse light and make it more uniform. It is recommended to test it for real before gluing.



## Glue "Wormhole-outer-rim.stl"
