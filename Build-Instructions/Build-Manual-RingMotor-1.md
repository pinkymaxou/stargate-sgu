# Ring/base assembly

The design is relatively modular so you can make your own base if you want as long as the ring assembly fit into it.
It is partly designed as base and ring so I decided to create a specific chapter for this part.

## Instructions

- Glue "Truss#1_4mm-x1.stl" and "Truss#1_4mm-x2.stl" anywhere (check the picture). It's the same part.
Use Gorilla Glue, it's a structural part.

## Install the ring to the base

Use nuts to install the ring to the base. It allow to easily remove the ring later if necessary.

### Required parts

- "Bottom-plate-v2_4mm-x1.stl", "Truss#1_4mm-x1.stl" and "Truss#2_4mm-x1.stl".
- 4x M3x15 screws but as long as it fit it's fine it could be longer too.
- 4x M3 nuts

## Install hidden nuts

This part is tricky because it may be required to use a lighter to insert M3 nuts into place.
If M3 nuts fit you can just fit them with force, but if it doesn't you can use the longest possible M3 screw you can find, install the M3 nuts to it, then use a lighter to heat the nut then push very hard on the plastic part to force it to enter. It will make the nuts fit perfectly and stay in place without using glue.

## Glue to the bottom plate

Using Gorilla Glue, glue "Stepper-mount-1_4mm-x1.stl" to the "Bottom-plate-v2_4mm-x1.stl".
Use clamp to hold the part in place and ensure glue won't go into the nuts.
